# WOD_randomizer
Simple script to pull a random WOD from crossfit.com (workout only) and can then be displayed on a monitor in your gym

Still need to add a running clock to the webpage to allow timing via the webpage as well. Also need to add error handling for request fails or random rolls that land on rest day WODs.
