# WOD_randomizer
Simple script to pull a random WOD from crossfit.com (workout only) and can then be displayed on a monitor in your gym. Local HTML file displays a timer for ease of tracking/timing WODs. 



Need to add error handling for request fails or random rolls that land on rest day WODs. Could use some css beautifying but come on, who cares. 

The real purpose of this was to practice web scraping, parsing, transforming, and utilizing arbitrary web data.
